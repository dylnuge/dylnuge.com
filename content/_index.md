## About Me

My name is Dylan Nugent, and I work and play with software. I enjoy building
systems, understanding systems, and writing about how they work. My writing
isn't connected by a more complex theme than "things I want to write about."
Usually that's tech related, either programming or engineering leadership.
Sometimes it's music, running, backpacking, mental health, or video games.

I currently work at [The New York Times](nytimes.com) on our GraphQL API,
caching infrastructure, and common services platform.

This blog doesn't support comments but if you have questions, feel free to reach
out—my Twitter DMs are usually open, and I'm available on Keybase and Signal if
you're concerned about privacy. I'm also a member of a number of tech (and
non-tech) Slacks and Discords. Chances are good if you see a "dylnuge" it's me.

Thanks for stopping by!

## Projects, Articles, and Talks

This website is relatively new, so here's a collection of stuff I've done online
before I set this up.

### Let's Implement DNS to Learn History (!!con 2020)

I delievered a [talk on quirks of DNS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFAgpqFi3No) and what they tell us about the history of computing at [!!con 2020](https://bangbangcon.com/2020/). I love putting systems in the context of the people who created them. This talk was a joy to create and deliver, and was my first time speaking at a public conference (as well as my first time giving a talk remotely).

### Smashing Stacks

I did a talk for BlueVoyant on the concept of stack smashing and the paper by
Aleph One. I ran it as an interactive session where participants got to smash
stacks in the process. The talk recording is not publicly available, but check
out the slide deck or GitHub repository which contains both the example code and
original Keynote file.

<ul class="project-links">

    <a href="https://github.com/Dylnuge/stack-smashing">Git Repo</a>
    &mdash;
    The repo for the talk. There are three interactive examples (and
    some hints). Feel free to DM me on Twitter if you're actually trying
    this and get stuck or want to verify a solution.

      Slide Deck</a>
    &mdash;
    The slides for the talk. I don't have slide notes which makes them
    less useful as a visual aid, but unfortunately I don't have a public
    recording for the talk either. Again, if you're actually playing
    with this, feel free to DM me; I'd love to clarify things!
  </li>
</ul>

### Articles

I've written a couple of nonfiction articles in places other than this website.
Here they are.

<ul class="project-links">
  <li>
    <a href="https://medium.com/@dylnuge/chernobyl-devops-software-engineering-disaster-management-and-observability-8a50a7ea98d6">
      Chernobyl DevOps: Software Engineering, Disaster Management, and
      Observability</a>
    &mdash;
    A semi-detailed explanation of Chernobyl and some thoughts on what
    lessons we can take from it as software engineers. Probably my most
    technically involved writing, but most of the tech is nuclear
    physics and not software (go figure). It's framed in the context of
    the Chernobyl TV miniseries but doesn't really require watching
    it—though you should!
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://medium.com/@dylnuge/the-devastating-stereotype-of-the-artless-scientist-45c6348489ff">
      The Devastating Stereotype of the Artless Scientist</a>
    &mdash;
    An article I wrote on Medium after The Imitation Game came out,
    less about that film in particular than it is about my frustration
    with the socially incompetent scientist/engineer stereotype that
    pushes people away from scientific fields. This went viral at the
    time, so I kind of hate it now and would love to edit it.
  </li>
</ul>

### Other Random Things

None of this stuff is quite complete, but if you're looking to deep dive into
random stuff I've made public, here it is.

<ul class="project-links">
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Dylnuge/montague">Montague</a>
    &mdash;
    A simple lightweight recursive DNS server written in Rust.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Dylnuge/cryptopals">Cryptopals</a>
    &mdash;
    First two problem sets for the Cryptopals challenges by Matasano.
    I'd eventually like to go back and add more. I did this in Go,
    partially to learn Go at the time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/dylnuge/status/1072746366697299968">
      Twitter Thread on the Toxicity of "Genius Assholes"</a>
    &mdash;
    It's just a twitter thread, but I'm pretty happy with it. It's about
    an experience I had in college and how it helped me see that
    brandishing skill and intellect as a weapon damages projects. It's
    quick, just go read it.
  </li>
</ul>
