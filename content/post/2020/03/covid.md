This was my last week at Recurse Center in person; [we've closed as a precaution
for the COVID-19 pandemic and are going fully remote for at least the remainder
of my batch][closure].

COVID-19 and everything surrounding it is all so far outside my ordinary that I
don't really have mental models to deal with it. I haven't seen anything like it
before, and everyone else I talk to hasn't either. I'm not even sure what to
write, which is a weird feeling for me personally.

I came to Recurse Center in part to break away from the increasing isolation I
felt living in San Francisco. I'm so glad I did. I'm incredibly fortunate to not
be alone through all of this. I have my roommates. I have recursers (online,
through Zulip). I have so many people I can call and talk to. I started this
blog off with a post about how screens don't have to separate us. I guess now
I'm testing it for real.

So many things that happened at RC this week—a game jam, a circuit building
workshop, people jamming together in the music room—feel like hard things to
replicate remotely. I believe we can do it. Recurse Center is an incredible
space to be in, but so much of that is because of the incredible group of people
I've been there with.

This definitely feels like the end of something, but I'm still at RC for the
next eight weeks. There's still a new batch starting (remotely) in two weeks; if
you want to do RC but couldn't make being in New York physically work, now is an
excellent time to [apply][scout].

I don't know how to end this post either. Thanks for reading.
