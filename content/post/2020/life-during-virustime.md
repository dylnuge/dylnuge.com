+++

Since we're all alone together now, I wanted to share some resources[^1] I'm
looking at for socializing remotely and staying sane.

I won't focus on _working_ remotely, since a lot of other articles already do
that quite well, and ensuring we can keep working seems to be a default concern.
We tend to be a little less intentional about our social and mental well being,
and just hope it works by magic—that's the concern I want to address.

[^1]: I don't use all of these, but the ones I don't come recommended by people
  I trust. Some of these cost money or have non-free options. I'm not affiliated
  with any of these products and services, and I don't make any money from this
  post.

## Hanging Out With Friends

Instead of going to bars with friends or hanging out together and watching a
movie, we're going to need to socialize remotely. Messaging people on Facebook,
WhatsApp, or iMessage is already a default many of us practice, but many of
these apps also offer voice and video calling. Setting up a call helps us focus
on being with our friends (virtually) and not just asynchronously replying to
messages sent hours earlier.

Those things help us with 1:1 interactions (which are great!) but we can still
keep the parties going, too. Our hangouts don't have to shrink, and they don't
have to stop involving alcohol, movies, and games just because we're not
gathering for them, either. Here are some tools I've found to help:

* **[Netflix Party][netflix-party]** is a Chrome extension that lets you
  synchronize your Netflix stream with other people and gives you a chat room to
  talk. Text chatting allows people to "talk" during the movie without
  interrupting other people who want to hear what's going on, and you can each
  independently control the volume and choose whether or not you want closed
  captioning. It's basically better than an in-person movie night!
* **[JQBX][jqbx]** is a Spotify app for sharing music and chatting. If
  music-centered group hangs aren't a thing you've tried yet, do! I totally love
  them; everyone gets to share some music, and you can alternate between
  actively hanging out and just listening to some songs your friends have queued
  up. This does require a Spotify Premium subscription to use.
* **[Discord][discord]** is likely a tool you're already familiar with (if
  you're not, it's a group chat app similar to Slack), but if you haven't set up
  a server with friends where you occasionally voice chat, you're missing out on
  one of the best features! There's also a pretty full-fledged feature set
  around organizing multiplayer video game sessions.
* Tabletop RPGs can be played remotely! This is relatively easy for more
  narrative campaigns (like some D&D campaigns and any game of Fiasco) but a lot
  harder if you want to do something with miniatures; for that,
  **[Roll20][roll20]** is a website with a nice set of tools for easier remote
  RPG play.

## Activities To Do

Right now it might seem like your social calendar is decidedly empty. The
vacation you were planning next month is canceled, the concert next weekend is
totally canceled, and all other events are pending. Sitting inside and reading a
book or watching Netflix can help, but what do you do once you've finished _The
Power Broker_ and binged the entire run of _Friends_?

Great news; we don't have to go out to go out! There are a ton of events that
are being moved online instead of fully canceled; from nightclub DJ sets to the
Met Opera, you can stream them from the comfort of your own home. A lot of these
are entirely free or donation-supported too, so if you've never gotten into
musical theater because it seems too expensive to be worth it or you don't live
in a city that gets a lot of shows, now you can try it out without the cost and
effort!

And if you're running out of things to read or watch? Your local libraries might
be shut down, but many of them offer extensive catalogs of online materials (and
not just books—movies and music and tons of other things too).

There's so many things online it'd be hard for me to exhaustively list them, but
here's some I find cool:[^2]

* [Broadway, the Met Opera, the Chamber Music Society, and more are streaming
  past performances online.][vogue-streaming]
* Prefer to walk around a museum? No problem! [Over 3,000 museums have their
  collections available on Google Street View][museum-view]. The Google search
  interface here is ironically wonky, but if you're not sure where to start, why
  not [the Met][met-street-view]?
* Sad to be missing out on St. Patrick's Day festivities? Great news! You (yes,
  you) have tickets to see [Flogging Molly on Tuesday, fully from the
  comfort of your own home][flogging-molly].
* You already know all about Netflix and Hulu, but have you heard of
  [Quello][quello], which has extremely high quality concerts and music
  documentaries?
* Like I said above, you should check out your local library's online content.
  Then you should check out [Libby][libby], which is a free app that delivers a
  bunch of that content straight to you. You don't even have to worry about
  returning stuff late anymore!

[^2]: This list is weighted towards New York things, because I live here. But
  it's all streaming, so you don't _have_ to live here!

## Finding Communities

If you feel alone right now, you're not alone.  A ton of people are searching
for things to do and like-minded people to hang out with; you don't need in
person events to find new friends. There are ways to find people to socialize
with.

* Slack communities tend to be organized around work topics, but there are
  thousands of them out there. [Slofile][slofile] has a decent
  list, broken down by interest category.
* Or join a Discord! These tend to be gaming focused, but again, there are
  thousands of them, and plenty have entirely independent focuses.
  [DiscordMe][discordme] has the best list I've found here.
* If there's a creator on YouTube or Twitch you like, there's a good chance they
  have a Discord of their own, by the way. Some of these are exclusive to Twitch
  subscribers or Patreons, but many aren't, and they're great for finding like
  minded people.
* Giant subreddits rarely feel like a community, but check out
  [SnoopSnoo][snoopsnoo] and find some of the smaller ones that line up with
  your interests.

## Self-Care and Maintaining Sanity

The internet is great but it also kinda sucks. I'm a fan of spending time
playing games and chatting with friends, but the large-scale social "discourse"
that winds up happening on Twitter or the endless black holes of Reddit can
often just be exhausting.

Taking breaks is important and can help, of course—it appears to be OK to go for
a walk outside so long as we're avoiding touching surfaces and direct contact
with other people. So really, do that!

But there are also some technology tools I like for making things better:[^3]
* If you've ever read a YouTube comments section  and said to yourself "wow,
  what an insightful and well reasoned discussion," you probably followed it up
  by bunkering down for the end-times. The aptly named [Hide Youtube
  Comments][hide-comments] extension will remove those comments and restore your
  sanity.
* Many of my friends are on Facebook Messenger or schedule things with Facebook
  Events, so I'll probably never fully leave the Facebook ecosystem. At the same
  time, the News Feed is something I never want to see again. And again, [an
  extension is here to help][news-feed-eradicator].
* Don't want to kill off your social media habits entirely, but just want to
  control the time you spend on them? The [Freedom][freedom-to] app and the
  [StayFocusd][stayfocusd] extension can both help here.
* Did you know [Netflix lets you disable autoplay][autoplay-off] now on a
  profile-by-profile basis? Well, they do! And it works on all your devices!


And remember, **you are not alone**. If you're completely overwhelmed and just
need to talk to someone but don't know where to turn, the [Crisis Text
Line][crisis-text-line] has you covered.  Also my DMs are open, feel free to hit
me up.

  equivalents in Firefox and other browsers that support extensions.

## Charities and Service

Last but definitely not least, when things get this bad, I usually want to know
what I can do to help. Right now the traditional volunteering avenues—that is to
say, in-person ones—are a bit contrary to social distancing.

However, there are still tons of places you can give your money and time to, if
you're able. In addition to people fighting the virus itself, the impacts on
people without health insurance and people whose work is threatened by this like
those in the service industry, events industry, gig workers, and artists are
pretty massive. Anything you can do will help. This disease will take all of us
working against it. My personal picks are:

* [Check out these resources from the Center for Disaster Philanthropy][cdp].
* Give money to artists you like and support on [Patreon][patreon], and look
  around for people in dire straights who need help on [GoFundMe][gofundme].
* [Crisis Text Line][crisis-text-line-volunteer], which I mentioned above, needs
  volunteers to help people in crisis. Check it out!
* Local volunteering lists; there's things you can do to help out in your
  neighborhood without needing to get on transit or break social distancing.
  [Here's a set of ones for people living in New York][nyc-volunteering], but I
  bet you can find them for your city too. Get groceries for a sick neighbor
  (and leave them outside the door) or watch kids or pitch in some money for
  someone in a tight spot. [Here are some suggestions from the New York
  Times][nyt-volunteering], but seriously, do whatever you can do!

If you have any suggestions to add to this article, please let me know! Unlike
my usual stance on updating articles, I intend to keep this one alive and add
resources as they're recommended to me (or remove any that turn out to have
problems).[^4]
